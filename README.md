# spotify-challenge
Spotify challenge for UW INFO343 class.

What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?

	My idea was to have users input their mood or current musical interest and get a list of music and they can choose a song they want to sample depending on its popularity.

What is the URL of this project on your student web-server?
    
	http://students.washington.edu/dthoang/info343/spotify-challenge

Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
    
	I received help from Alison Wong and Royce Le.

Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
    
	It took me roughly 23 hours.

Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

	I don't really know why the Spotify API/using angular was so tricky for me. My best advice for someone approaching the challenge is probably to just play around with the template without committing to an idea. The API instructions on the spotify website itself is pretty confusing, and finding more efficient ways to navigate through their objects was a pain.
